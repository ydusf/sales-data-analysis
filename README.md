# Sales Data Analysis Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis of a sales dataset, focusing on using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels libraries in Python.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a sales dataset to gain insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance. By applying various data analysis techniques and visualizations, we aim to uncover trends, correlations, and key factors affecting sales.

## Dataset

The sales dataset used in this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data. It contains records of sales transactions, including information such as sales amounts, dates, customer details, and product attributes. The dataset is provided in CSV format and consists of multiple columns, including `SALES`, `MONTH_ID`, `CONTACTFIRSTNAME`, `PRICEEACH`, and more.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the sales dataset file(s).
- `analysis/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data loading, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and analysis.
- `results/`: This directory stores any generated plots, visualizations, or analysis outputs.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git

2. Install required dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Execute the cells in the notebooks sequentially to load the data, perform analysis, generate visualizations, and derive insights.

5. The results, including visualizations and analysis outputs, will be saved in the results/ directory.

## Results and Visualizations

After analyzing the sales dataset, we have identified the following key insights:

- The highest sales amount was recorded on 4/14/2005, reaching 97.
- The sales trend over time shows a significant spike during April and June.
- There is a strong positive correlation between [variable A] and [variable B].
- Product category [category name] has the highest sales volume.
- The regression analysis reveals that [independent variable(s)] significantly affect the sales amount.
- A selection of visualizations generated during the analysis can be found in the results/ directory.

## Future Improvements

- Implement machine learning models to forecast future sales based on historical data.
- Incorporate interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh.
- Perform more advanced statistical analyses, such as time series decomposition or clustering.
